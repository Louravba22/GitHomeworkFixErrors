# Git Homework - Fix Errors

My child - Linus - came home today from school with his homework but he got SOME of the questions wrong!

Can you help him to fix or improve the answers to his homework?

1. You should `fork` this repository
2. Clone the repository to your computer
3. Create a branch with an appropriate name for the task you're on
3. Fix the errors in Linus's homework in `homework.md`
4. Create a Pull Request from your branch back to your Main (NOT MIGRACODE repo) with the correct answers.
5. Share the link to your Pull Request with your class to be reviewed and give feedback to others.

Do not submit the PR to be Reviewed in the Google Form for Volunteers.
